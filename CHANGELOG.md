# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) conventions.

## [1.56.0] — 2026-08-29

### Added
- 01-05 improvement tracker: a small toggle next to every stat and skill marks the permanent +1 as already claimed, and clears automatically the next time the party arrives at a settlement — matching the rulebook's "once between each settlement visits" wording rather than resetting per dungeon
- Offhand Weapon slot on the hero sheet, unlocked once a hero has the Dual Wield talent. Picking a Dual Wield-tagged weapon shows its DMG bonus and the +5 two-weapon parry bonus automatically; picking a non-Dual-Wield weapon flags that it can't be used offhand

### Changed
- Start of Turn now advances the round in the same action: rolling it resets every hero's AP to 2, counts down light sources, and rolls the Scenario die (and Threat, if triggered) in one tap — removing the separate "Next Round" step. The round counter moved up into the Start of Turn panel so it's still visible at a glance

## [1.55.0] — 2026-08-25

### Changed
- Short Rest fully rewritten to match the current rulebook (physical book, matching QRS v2.25 — confirmed superseding the older PDF, and confirmed directly by the game designer). Threat Level is no longer touched by Short Rest at all. The rest now works as: −1 food ration (always) → a manual toggle for whether a Wandering Monster on the board spotted the party during its 3 moves (the app doesn't track board position, so this stays a player call) → if interrupted, the rest stops there and battle begins; if not, Party Morale +2, HP +1d6/hero, Energy regen (or full with a Bed Roll), and full Mana for casters are applied
- A rest counter now tracks completed Short Rests taken since entering the current dungeon, resetting only on Exit Dungeon (not per dungeon level) — this drives the new Ambush mechanic below

### Added
- Ambush roll after every uninterrupted Short Rest: risk = 5% + current Threat Level, +10% for each rest after the first this dungeon (capped at 70% total). A "Door barred" toggle lets you flag if the party used iron wedges or Seal Door beforehand. Rolling 1d100 against that risk resolves the Ambush automatically — rolling on the Encounter Table (defaulting to the dungeon's last-used monster category, editable), noting enemy placement outside the entry door, randomizing which hero starts awake and ready, and applying the correct prone/initiative-token outcome depending on whether the door was barred

## [1.54.1] — 2026-08-25

### Fixed
- Desktop sidebar (1024px+) was overlapping the Footer and causing the page to scroll oddly. Root cause was the sidebar's `height: 100vh` being miscalculated against the app's desktop zoom scale-up (`zoom: 1.2`/`1.35` in index.css), rendering it taller than what's actually visible on screen. Switched the sidebar to `position: fixed` with `inset-y-0` (no viewport-height value involved, so the zoom mismatch can't happen) and moved the Footer to sit directly after the main content in the same layout container so it's correctly offset instead of running full-width underneath the sidebar

## [1.54.0] — 2026-08-23

### Added
- Quick Finds on the Dice tab's Loot Roller panel: one-tap "Spell Scroll", "Ingredient", and "Part" buttons for Treasure Card or furniture results that just say "1 random X" with no skill check involved. Rolls a uniform-random result and sends it straight to a chosen hero's backpack (scrolls) or Alchemy Components (ingredients/parts)
- A toast notification now confirms every Quick Find and Loot Roller scroll pickup (e.g. "Found: Scroll of Fireball — Sent to Thorn's backpack"), so it's not easy to miss after scrolling away from the result

## [1.53.2] — 2026-08-23

### Added
- Footer: a "Found a bug? Report it here" link next to Changelog, opening the GitHub issues page in a new tab

### Fixed
- Rest at Inn: HP, Mana, Luck, and Energy recovery was calculated and shown in the confirmation summary and log, but never actually applied to the hero sheets, due to a mismatched function signature between the Settlement tab and the underlying hero-update call. Resting now correctly updates every selected hero's stats

## [1.53.1] — 2026-08-23

### Fixed
- **Data-safety hardening, prompted by a real coin-pouch corruption report.** The one-time coin-pouch migration from v1.51.0 relied solely on a `coinsMigrated` flag to guarantee it only ever ran once; if that flag ever failed to persist, the migration would silently re-run on every future load, overwriting every hero's real personal coins with an even split of the current Party Pot. It's now also guarded independently: if every hero already has a real numeric `coins` value, the migration is treated as already done regardless of the flag, so it can't re-fire and flatten personal pouches again
- Loading the active campaign on startup silently fell back to a brand-new blank campaign if its saved data ever failed to read — and the very next autosave would then persist that blank campaign right over the real one on disk. It now shows a "Couldn't load your campaign" screen with a Reload button instead, and never writes anything until a real read succeeds

## [1.53.0] — 2026-08-23

### Added
- Buy Gear panel on the Settlement tab, right below Sell & Repair — Weapons and Armour & Shields (Blacksmith) and General Equipment (General Store / Magic Brewery), using the same "roll 1d6 vs Availability, deduct cost, drop into the chosen hero's backpack" mechanic the Guild shops already use. All three are collapsible accordion sections (only one open at a time, matching the Guilds tab's pattern) so the panel doesn't turn into one long scroll on mobile. General Equipment also gets category filter chips (Alchemy, Consumables, Jewellery, Light, Misc, Tools) since it's ~35 items across 6 categories
- Desktop left sidebar (1024px+): the header and both scrolling tab rows collapse into a sticky sidebar with all 16 tabs grouped under "Core Loop" and "World & Campaign", freeing up the wide empty margins a centered mobile-first layout leaves on a desktop screen. Mobile/tablet layout below 1024px is completely unchanged — same header, same two tab rows, same behavior

### Fixed
- Sell & Repair: selling a named backpack item (as opposed to an equipped weapon or worn armour) always showed 0 Lost Durability regardless of its actual condition, since backpack items store durability as a free-text "cur/max" string rather than the structured field weapons/armour use, and the Sell panel wasn't parsing it. Now parses the same way the rest of the app already does, so a Longsword at 2/6 correctly shows 4 Lost Durability and the right sell value

## [1.52.1] — 2026-08-22

### Fixed
- Longbow was set to weapon Class 4 instead of Class 6 — confirmed against the official von Braus FAQ ("No, it is supposed to be class 6"). This also corrects its two-handed STR requirement to 20, matching Class 6's rules
- Close Combat/Ranged To-Hit calculator: the Enemy TO HIT/DEFENCE field was subtracting the value you entered, but the Bestiary's own To Hit stat is already stored pre-signed (e.g. a Bandit is "-5") to match what's printed on the monster card. Typing that printed value in was flipping its effect and raising your effective CS/RS instead of lowering it. The field is now added directly, so entering the card's value works correctly
- Close Combat/Ranged To-Hit calculator now has a "Fill enemy To Hit/Defence from Bestiary" picker, sourced straight from the Monster Table, so the correct signed value can be selected instead of typed in

## [1.52.0] — 2026-08-22

### Added
- Dwarf and Elf character creation now has a Subspecies picker (Advanced Bestiary): Nozhrak, Derthzak, Noarzth, Fizrtheg, Dergthaz, Glanrak, and Kiirahkz for Dwarves; Wald-adjaar'ii, Mondel-adjaar'ii, and Sethel-adjaar'ii for Elves — each with a note card and one-tap buttons to grant the Talent(s)/skill bonus it comes with. Wood Elves can also take a Pudoa'ii (now in the Weapon picker) instead of their profession's usual starting weapon
- Duckfolk, Frogling, Gnome, Pale Orc, and Pale Goblin now have their full Traits and profession limitations from the Advanced Bestiary, auto-applied on "Roll Starting Stats" the same way Elf/Dwarf/Half-Ogre traits already were. Half-Ogre's "+2 Sanity" is now a real, formal Tough Mind talent instead of just a note. Duckfolk's base stats corrected (CON 25→20, DEX 30→40)
- Stat Maximum caps added for all 10 species (previously only Duckfolk and Half-Ogre had them) — also corrects two existing errors (Duckfolk WIS was 70, should be 80; Half-Ogre CON/RES were 60, should be 80)
- 10 new Talents/Perks added to the Compendium: Battle Hardened, Cat and Dog, Jumper, Linked to the Void, Natural Illusionist, Now You See Me…, Shunned, Slippery, Weak with Destruction Magic, Natural Swimmers
- Legendary Items with a real Weapon/Armour type (Breastplate of Rannulf, Armour of the Father, Golden Khopesh, Bow of Divine Twilight, and 6 others) can now be equipped directly into the hero's actual gear slot — swaps out whatever was worn before, and fills in the item's real DMG/DEF/ENC at 8 DUR (the Magic Items rule). Previously these just sat as a description card with no way to equip them
- Legendary Items are now immune to the Durability loss step in Resolve a Hit, matching the rulebook ("never run out of magic and can't be damaged") — ordinary magic gear is unaffected

### Fixed
- Alchemist Belt now actually expands Quick Slots from 3 to 9 as the rulebook states — the extra 6 slots are restricted to potions/vials only, with a clear message if a non-bottle item is moved there instead. Previously the belt had no effect on Quick Slot capacity at all

## [1.51.1] — 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- Pool to Party moved a hero's entire pouch with no way to send a partial amount — now opens the same amount-entry panel as Lend, so any amount up to the full pouch can be pooled
- Take from Party used a plain browser prompt instead of matching the app's UI — now uses the same inline amount panel as Pool and Lend
- Lend's amount field could be typed into the negative — all three pouch-transfer amount fields now clamp to zero or above
- Pool, Take, and Lend now show a confirmation message after a successful transfer, instead of no feedback at all

## [1.51.0] — 2026-08-21

### Added
- Personal coin pouches: each hero now has their own coin pouch (starting at 150c), matching the rulebook's Setup section — separate from the Party Pot, which is now used for shared costs (gambling, estate, transport, guild training, inn, drinking & carousing, settlement events)
- Hero sheet: "Pool to Party" and "Take from Party" buttons transfer coins between a hero's own pouch and the Party Pot
- Hero sheet: "Lend" lets a hero send coins directly to another hero's pouch (amount + hero picker), matching the rulebook's separate "lend money" mechanic
- Hero-specific costs — buying gear at a guild shop, learning a spell or prayer, repairing an item, and buying a potion — now show a "Pay from" picker (Party Pot or any hero's pouch), defaulting to the hero's own pouch, with each option showing its balance and blocking the transaction if it can't cover the cost
- Existing campaigns migrate automatically on next load: the old shared coin total splits evenly across current heroes into their new personal pouches, with any remainder (from an uneven split) staying in the Party Pot — total party wealth is unchanged, just redistributed
- Half-Ogre's "Stupid" racial talent now auto-populates on "Roll Starting Stats," matching how Elf and Dwarf traits already worked — previously had to be added manually from the Compendium
- Hero name field now shows a pencil icon and an underline on focus, making it clearer it's editable (renaming a hero already worked, it just wasn't obvious)

## [1.50.2] — 2026-08-20

### Fixed
- Resolve a Hit: the Head/Torso Sanity and Quick Slot prompts now appear whenever that location is selected — whether picked manually from the Location dropdown or via "Roll 1d6 Hit Location" — instead of only showing up after rolling. Manually selecting Head or Torso was silently skipping the prompt entirely
- Resolve a Hit: the Hit Location roll's flavour note now clears when the Location is changed afterward, instead of lingering and no longer matching what's selected

## [1.50.1] — 2026-08-20

### Fixed
- Sticky sub-nav and back-to-top button now correctly track the app's actual scroll container (a pre-existing CSS quirk means `#root`, not `window`, is what scrolls) — the back-to-top button was never appearing, and the sub-nav's active-section highlight was stuck on the first item regardless of scroll position
- Sticky section sub-nav now rescans whenever a tab's own internal sub-navigation changes its content (e.g. Combat's Close Combat/Ranged/Throw Potion/etc. buttons), not just when switching the outer app tab
- Campaigns tab: saved campaigns list now sits under a "Saved Campaigns" heading, so it shows up in the section sub-nav like every other list
- Combat tab: "Resolve a Hit" now shows a persistent inline confirmation after applying a hit, instead of silently resetting to blank

### Changed
- Combat tab: the "Damage" mode has been folded into "Resolve a Hit" — Weapon DMG/Damage Bonus/Natural Armour calculation and the Hit Location roller (with its Head/Torso Sanity and Quick Slot side-effects) are now part of the same tool that resolves damage against a hero's actual equipped armour, instead of two separate, overlapping calculators

## [1.50.0] — 2026-08-20

### Added
- Stacking Armour: hero sheet now supports the Stackable special rule — a "+ Stack Armour" button appears on any equipped Stackable piece, offering only other Stackable pieces of a different tier at that location. Outer/inner layering (higher tier outer, Bracers always outer regardless of tier), combined DEF (inner halved, rounded down), and total ENC are all calculated automatically
- Combat tab: new "Resolve a Hit" tool — enter incoming damage against a hero's actual equipped armour at a location (single piece or stacked) and it walks through the full resolution automatically: outer DEF, outer DUR loss (only if it didn't fully absorb), inner DEF, inner DUR loss, remainder to HP. A piece that reaches 0 DUR breaks beyond repair and is removed automatically, with a toast confirming it
- Weapon and Armour pickers now group options into "In Your Backpack" and "All Items (reference)", so it's easy to see what's already owned versus the full rulebook list
- Heroes tab: hero-switcher bar is now sticky, staying pinned while scrolling through a hero's sheet — switching heroes no longer requires scrolling back to the top
- Every tab now gets an auto-generated, sticky jump-to-section nav bar (built from that page's own section headings) once it has more than one section, plus a floating back-to-top button once scrolled down
- Hero sheet: a small "Close" link now appears next to the re-shown creation tools panel, letting it be collapsed again after tapping "Show creation tools again"

### Fixed
- Hero sheet: the "all creation tools done" check now computes live from the hero's actual Talents/Perks instead of a cached flag, fixing a bug where using the Compendium tab's "Attach to hero" to add a starting Perk (the natural path for Wizards, whose pick is any of 5 Arcane Perks) never marked that step as done, leaving the creation tools panel stuck open
- Turn tab: the Initiative Bag now persists at the party level instead of resetting when switching tabs — matches the rulebook, where drawn tokens for still-living models return to the bag and get reused across multiple turns of the same battle, not rebuilt each turn
- Armour data: Padded Vest was missing its Stackable tag

## [1.49.0] — 2026-08-20

### Added
- Alchemy tab: "+ Add Component Manually" on the Components panel, for ingredients or parts found in-story that weren't auto-gathered or harvested — pick a name from the rulebook's own list, or choose "Other" to type a custom name, with quantity and an Exquisite toggle
- Hero sheet: the Roll Starting Stats, Apply Starting Equipment, and Apply Starting Talents/Perks tools now auto-collapse into a small "Show creation tools again" link once all three have been used, keeping a finished hero's sheet uncluttered — tapping the link brings them back any time

## [1.48.0] — 2026-08-18

### Added
- Hero sheet: "+ Learn Spell (Wizards' Guild)" and "+ Learn Prayer (Inner Sanctum)" buttons, shown only for professions that can actually learn spells (Wizard, Druid) or prayers (Warrior Priest) — jumps straight to the Guilds tab, opens the correct guild box, and pre-selects the hero, matching the existing "+ Add Talent / Perk" button's pattern

## [1.47.0] — 2026-08-17

### Added
- Dungeon Status card at the top of the Travel tab — tracks the party as In Settlement, Travelling, or In Dungeon, with dedicated actions for each transition (Depart Settlement, Arrive at Settlement, Enter Dungeon, Exit Dungeon)
- Exiting a dungeon now automatically clears every hero's "until next dungeon exit" Temporary Effects (Temple boons, Curses) in one action, instead of relying on the old manual "Left dungeon — clear all" tap — with a confirmation step first since it can't be undone
- Dungeon Status persists with the saved campaign, so closing the app mid-dungeon doesn't lose track of where the party is

## [1.46.0] — 2026-08-15

### Added
- Hero sheet: "Apply Starting Talents/Perks" button for every profession, granting the real fixed Talents/Perks each profession starts with (e.g. Warrior gets Disciplined + Heroic Force of Will, Knight gets all 4 of its Talents plus 2 Perks) — same pattern as the existing Apply Starting Equipment button, safe to press more than once
- Where a profession offers a player choice instead of a fixed grant, that choice now appears directly on the hero sheet: Warrior and Warrior Priest show tap-to-pick buttons for their named Talent choice (Mighty Blow/Braveheart, Confident/Braveheart), and Wizard shows a dropdown filtered to just Arcane Perks for its "choose one Arcane Perk" pick
- "+ Add Talent / Perk" button on every hero sheet, jumping straight to the Compendium tab with that hero and the Talents category already pre-selected

## [1.45.0] — 2026-08-15

### Added
- Quest Book II: Backer Quests now show "Written by [author]" under each title, pulled from the book's own credits, replacing the old "titles only confirmed" placeholder note

### Changed
- Quest Book I now matches Quest Book II's layout for consistency: a single "Quest Book I: Main Quests" panel (First Blood, then The Dead Rising and Lair of the Spider Queen as inline sub-checklists with progress counters), and "Quests into the Ancient Lands" renamed to "Quest Book I: Ancient Lands"
- Quest tab reordered: Random Quests moved above the Quest Book I sections, and Side Quests moved to sit between Quest Book I and Quest Book II

## [1.44.1] — 2026-08-15

### Fixed
- Quest Book II: Main Quests now render as a single list in table-of-contents order (Cult of the Hydra, Witches, Halls of the Goblin King, The Northern Tombs, then the single-page quests) instead of the multi-stage campaigns appearing as separate boxes above the rest, out of order — Backer Quests and Mini Quests remain their own boxes below
- Removed a leftover line from the Main Quests panel that no longer matched what it now shows

## [1.44.0] — 2026-08-15

### Added
- Quest Book II: four Main Quests with confirmed multi-stage structure now have their own checklists with progress counters — Cult of the Hydra (5 stages), Halls of the Goblin King (6 holds), The Northern Tombs (3 tombs), and Witches (6 stages) — moved out of the flat title list into the same format as The Dead Rising and Lair of the Spider Queen
- Lore tab: 3 new entries — Teezmeald the Vile and the Seven Holds, The Northern Tribes and the Grand Chiefs (History), and Kyaris, the Five-Headed (Deities)
- Compendium: Crown of Aulfric added to Legendary Items (+2 Initiative Tokens on the first turn of combat, no helmet, can't be sold), with a matching Lore entry

## [1.43.0] — 2026-08-15

### Changed
- Nav reordered to group tabs by when you'd actually reach for them: live-play tabs (Party, Turn, Heroes, Combat, Bestiary, Actions, Alchemy, Dice, Reference) come first, downtime/between-quest tabs (Travel, Settlement, Guilds, Quest, Compendium, Lore, Campaigns) come second — Bestiary and Reference moved up since they're needed mid-fight, not just as an afterthought
- Nav is now two independently-scrollable rows instead of one long row — the live-play group and the downtime group are each visible at a glance, so you're not swiping through all 16 tabs to get from Combat to Travel

## [1.42.0] — 2026-08-15

### Added
- Scrolls Salesman settlement event now actually lets you buy — pick a hero and tap Buy (100c) on one of the 3 random spell offers to add a real Scroll to their backpack, instead of just listing what's on offer
- Loot Roller's T4 "1 random scroll" result now rolls an actual spell and lets you add the Scroll straight to a chosen hero's backpack

### Fixed
- DiceTray was the one tab in the app still wired to the raw two-argument updateHero instead of the single-object adapter every other tab uses — harmless until this session's new Loot Roller code needed it, since it would have silently failed to add scrolls to a hero's backpack

## [1.41.0] — 2026-08-15

### Added
- Read a Magic Scroll (Combat tab, next to Spells) — any hero can attempt a scroll straight from their own inventory. Uses WIS instead of Arcane Arts, Casting Value is reduced by 10 (min 0), and Focus is never allowed. The scroll is automatically removed from the hero's backpack on a successful cast, a dispelled cast, or a miscast — it survives a plain failure or a missed touch roll

## [1.40.0] — 2026-08-15

### Added
- Close Combat To-Hit calculator now has checkable Charge (+10) and Power attack (+20) modifiers, matching the QRS To-Hit table — previously only documented in prose, not available as a toggle
- Close Combat/Ranged To-Hit results now surface next-step guidance: a hit shows a "Go to Damage" shortcut with a reminder of the damage formula, a natural 01-05 flags Bloodlust (roll DMG twice, take the higher — or automatic max on a Power Attack), and a 00 result notes the weapon-damage/drop-weapon rule

### Changed
- Nav order: Heroes moved up to right after Turn, and Combat moved to right after Heroes, so in-session tabs sit together instead of split up by out-of-dungeon tabs
- Dice tab's plain "Hit Location (d6)" button removed in favour of the fully automated version on Combat → Damage (hero-linked, auto-applies Sanity/Durability effects) — a note now points there instead

### Fixed
- Party tab's Threat note referenced "Start of Turn above", which moved to the Turn tab in the last version — now points to the right place

## [1.39.0] — 2026-08-15

### Added
- Encounter Roller in the Turn tab — pick a faction (Beasts, Orcs and Goblins, Bandits and Brigands, Reptiles, Dark Elves, Undead, Ancient Lands), and it rolls the real 1d20 + level bonus against the full table, rolls the resulting creature count, and links each result to its Monster Table stats where the name matches

### Changed
- Turn tab reordered to match the rulebook's actual Turn Sequence: Start of Turn, Initiative Bag, Round, Action Points, Encounter Roller, Roll Enemy Action, Light Sources, Trade Gear, Short Rest

### Fixed
- Bestiary monster stat blocks (CS/RS/DMG/NA/M/DEX/RES/To Hit) were unreadable — dark text on a dark background
- Lore tab's Bestiary filter could get stuck showing the wrong "The Ancient Lands" entry (there are two lore entries with that title, one under World and one under Bestiary) — each now opens its own correct text

## [1.38.0] — 2026-08-14

### Added
- Bestiary: full 100-entry Monster Table with complete stat blocks (CS/RS/DMG/NA/M/DEX/RES/To Hit/Type/Behaviour/Special Rules/XP/Loot), searchable and filterable by faction in a new Bestiary tab
- Special Rules glossary browsable in the same tab, alongside the existing rule set already used for hero equipment effects
- "Roll Enemy Action" panel in the Turn tab — walks through the Monster Behaviour AI logic for all 6 creature categories (Humanoid Close Combat, Humanoid Missile, Beast, Higher Undead, Lower Undead, Magic User) and rolls the real d10 tables for a result
- Lore tab: new "Bestiary" category covering faction overviews (Bandits and Brigands, Orcs and Goblins, Dark Elves, The Undead, Beasts, Reptiles, The Ancient Lands) and Exotic Monster entries (Bloated Demon, Blood Demon, Lesser Plague Demon, Lurker, Psyker, Mimic, Drider, Naga, Shambler, Slime, Tomb Guardian, Plague Demon)
- Two new Deities lore entries: Ohlnir and Rhidnir

### Fixed
- Merged newly-sourced Special Rules into the existing glossary rather than duplicating it, and added the 4 genuinely missing entries (Fast, Groundbreaker, Lightning Fast, Pyrophobia)

## [1.37.0] — 2026-08-14

### Added
- Powerstones: successfully casting Enchant Item now auto-rolls the real 1d20 table and stores the result on the item — shown on the weapon's Dissipate button and logged. Full table also added to the Reference tab
- Quest tab: Campaign Quests restructured to match the rulebook's actual structure — First Blood as a standalone introductory quest, The Dead Rising campaign (7 quests: Spring Cleaning, The Dead Rising, Highwaymen, The Burning Village, The Apprentice, 6A Sacrifice, 6B The Master), and Lair of the Spider Queen (3 levels: The Entrance, The Basement, The Tomb of the Spider Queen) — each with its own progress counter
- Quest Book II section: Main Quests (11) and Backer Quests (12) checklists from its table of contents, plus a separate Mini Quests checklist (12 short standalone encounters)
- "Check off as you complete" notes added across all quest checklists

## [1.36.1] — 2026-08-14

### Added
- Quests into the Ancient Lands: all 5 quests now listed on the Quest tab checklist (The Pyramid of Xanthu, Tomb of the Hierophant, Temple of Despair, Hall of Amenhotep, Crypt of Khaba)

## [1.36.0] — 2026-08-14

### Added
- Bleeding Out: a hero at 0 HP now shows a dedicated panel — rolls the mandatory 1d4 permanent stat or HP loss, then offers Revive (set HP from a heal roll) or Hero Dies (permanently removes them from the party)
- Throwing Potions: new Combat tab mode with its own RS test, bonuses/penalties for Large enemies, throwing over obstacles, and throwing through doorways
- Hit Location roll (Combat tab, Damage calculator): 1d6 against Head/Arms/Torso/Legs when a hero is struck — Head applies −1 Sanity automatically, Torso rolls against the hero's actual Quick Slot items for durability damage
- Reference tab: Who Can Fight, Zone of Control, and End of Battle
- Quest tab overhaul: Campaign Quests checklist (First Blood, The Dead Rising, Lair of the Spider Queen), a Random Quests roller with its own checklist, and a Side Quests roller with its own checklist — completions log to the party log and persist with the campaign. Also includes a short rules box covering how to read quests, Wandering Monster triggers, and Ancient Lands travel requirements
- Nav bar can now be scrolled by clicking and dragging on desktop, not just on touch devices

### Fixed
- The Close Combat modifier "Enemy has a rapier" was named after one example weapon rather than the actual rule — renamed to "Enemy weapon has the Fast Rule"
- Poison's damage-type reference text described a rolling duration; corrected to the rulebook's actual two-checkpoint timing (next turn, then again 1d10 turns later)
- Fire and Acid follow-up damage now note the minimum-1 floor when it continues into the next turn

## [1.35.0] — 2026-08-14

### Added
- Lore tab: 45 world-building snippets pulled from the rulebook, covering the World, Races, Factions, History, Deities, and every one of the 31 Legendary Items — search and category filters, tap a card to expand it
- Legendary Item lore entries link straight through to their Compendium entry for the mechanics

## [1.34.3] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- The level-up points badge was still being clipped along the top edge of the hero tab button after the previous fix

## [1.34.2] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- The level-up points badge on a hero's tab button was getting clipped instead of sitting proud of the corner

## [1.34.1] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- Search Furniture now has a confirmed AP cost (1 AP out of combat, 2 AP with enemies in LOS) and a hero picker to spend it from, instead of being treated as a free action

## [1.34.0] — 2026-08-14

### Added
- Guilds tab: a new tab covering all six guilds (Fighters', Rangers', Wizards', Alchemists', The Dark Guild, The Inner Sanctum), picked by settlement, each as its own expandable card
- Skill Training at every guild — +3 to the relevant skills for 300c, one session per skill between dungeons, tracked automatically
- Buying Special Equipment at every guild now rolls the Availability check for you (1d6 at or under the listed Availability = in stock), deducts the cost, and drops the item straight into the chosen hero's backpack — covers the Fighters' Guild (Gauntlets, Gorget, Pain Killer, Poleyns, Shield Padding, Shoulder Pads, Slayer Weapon Treatment), Rangers' Guild (Aim Attachment, Barbed Arrows/Bolts, Compass, Skinning Knives, Taxidermist tools, Wild game traps), Wizards' Guild staffs, Dark Guild's Nightstalker Armour, and the Inner Sanctum's Religious Relics and Incense
- Nightstalker Armour (Dark Guild) added to the hero armour picker with its Dark as the Night and High Quality (DUR 8) rules
- Fighters' Guild Bounty Hunt: rolls 5 targets from the full enemy table, tracks which have been claimed for 250c each
- Rangers' Guild Taxidermist: sells a Trophy for 1d20 + the settlement's buyer modifier, one attempt per settlement per cycle
- Alchemists' Guild: buy a Part or Ingredient for 15c (Availability Roll first), or buy a named potion at Weak/Standard/Supreme strength
- Inner Sanctum Crusades: rolls the target enemy type, tracks trophies turned in for 25c each
- Inner Sanctum Blessing: bless a piece of armour (+1 Durability, 25c) or a weapon (+2 DMG vs Undead/Demons, 75c)
- Settlements tab now shows a single tappable "Guilds available here" card pointing to the new tab, instead of listing guild content inline

### Changed
- Wizards' Guild (Learn a Spell, Charge a Magic Item, Identify a Magic Item) and the Inner Sanctum (Learn a Prayer) moved from the Settlements tab into the new Guilds tab, alongside the other four guilds
- "Between Quests" on the Settlements tab now also resets Guild Skill Training, Bounty Hunt, Crusade, and Taxidermist once-per-cycle limits

## [1.33.0] — 2026-08-13

### Added
- Legendary Items: new Compendium category with all 31 items (p201-211) — unique, unsellable, never run out of magic or break, must be identified before use. 11 items with flat, unconditional bonuses (Amulet of Haamile, Gauntlets of Hraefnir, Belt of Copperbane, Crown of Resolve, Cloak of Elsewhyr, Priestly Dice, Boots of Energy, Ring of Awareness, Trap-sensing Ring, Armour of the Father) auto-apply when attached to a hero, same mechanism as Talents, reversible on removal. The rest stay as full reference text since their effects need live combat judgement (Sword of Lightning's chain lightning, Golden Khopesh's Undead-targeting override, Vampire's Brooch's per-hit roll, etc.)
- Profession equipment limits: armour Tier caps (Rogue/Alchemist/Thief/Barbarian/Ranger at Tier 3, Wizard at Tier 2) and Thief's Class 2 weapon cap now show as warnings directly on the Hero tab's weapon/armour editor, matching the existing STR-requirement warning style
- Apply Starting Equipment: new panel on the Hero tab, shown once a profession is picked. Auto-equips each profession's confirmed starting gear (weapon, armour, backpack items, backpack upgrade), with pickers for "of choice" items (weapon choice for Barbarian/Warrior/Warrior Priest, Rogue's Shortsword-or-Rapier, and a God + Ring/Amulet picker for the Warrior Priest's starting Religious Relic)
- Table of Relics (p194): the Warrior Priest's starting relic now applies its real effect — Charus +1 Energy, Iphy +5 RES, Rhidnir +1 Luck, Ohlnir +5 CS, Ramos +5 STR, Metheia +1d3 healing (reference-only, since it modifies a future roll rather than a flat stat) — plus a note on the 2-relic cap (3 with the Reliquary talent)

## [1.32.2] — 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- Wizards' Guild box header read "Wizards' Guild — Learn a Spell", crowding out the fact that Charge and Identify live there too — now just "Wizards' Guild", with "Learn a Spell" as its own subheading matching the other two

## [1.32.1] — 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- Identify a Magic Item required typing the item's name manually — it's now a dropdown of everything the hero actually owns (weapon, worn armour, and every backpack item), matching how Enchant Objects and Charge a Magic Item already work

### Added
- Search Furniture (Actions tab, next to Search a Tile): full 35-type table from Appendix V (p191-192) — pick the furniture, roll 1d10, get the correct result with any dice in it (coins, rations, etc.) auto-rolled and totalled. AP cost and skill check for this action aren't confirmed from the rulebook yet, so none is applied — treat it as a free action until that page turns up

## [1.32.0] — 2026-08-13

### Added
- Mithril: a "Make Mithril" toggle on a hero's weapon and each armour piece, applying the confirmed rulebook bonus (+1 DMG/-2 ENC for weapons, +1 DEF/-1 ENC for armour and shields), fully reversible
- Magic Workshop (Settlements tab, any settlement with an Inn): Enchant Objects (pick a hero who knows Enchant Item, a full-durability unenchanted item, roll Arcane Arts vs Casting Value 25 — success enchants the item to 8/8 Durability, failure destroys it) and Create a Scroll (pick a hero who knows Magic Scribbles, a known spell to inscribe, roll vs CV 20 — success adds a real Scroll item to the backpack, failure destroys the parchment), both correctly limited to one enchant OR two scroll attempts between quests
- Charge a Magic Item and Identify a Magic Item added to the Wizards' Guild box — Charge deterministically restores a dissipated (but not broken) magic item's Durability max back to 8, Identify rolls Arcane Arts against any named item
- A "Dissipate" button appears on enchanted weapons/armour in the Hero tab, for when 00 is rolled in combat — drops the item's Durability max back to 6 and clears its enchantment (recharge later at the Wizards' Guild)

### Changed
- The "Returned From Dungeon" reset (Estate room uses) moved out of the Silver-City-only Estate panel into a new "Between Quests" panel visible on the Settlements tab everywhere, since Magic Workshop's once-per-cycle limits needed the same reset and shouldn't require owning an estate

## [1.31.4] — 2026-08-13

### Added
- A short supportive note above the Buy Me a Coffee button in the footer: "Enjoying the app? A coffee keeps development going ☕"

## [1.31.3] — 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- Once used, Garden gathering and Archery Range/Training Grounds training locked permanently — there was no way to reset them for a new dungeon cycle. A "Returned From Dungeon" button now always shows in the estate panel, which activates any commissioned room and resets Garden/Training Grounds/Archery Range/Alchemist Lab usage for the next visit

## [1.31.2] — 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- Manor training (Archery Range / Training Grounds) gave no feedback when clicked — the result was being calculated but never displayed
- Commissioning a Manor room now shows a clear "Pending" badge and disables further commissions until it's activated, instead of looking like nothing happened
- Alberta's Magnificent Animals purchases (Horse, Camel, Saddlebags, Mule, Wagon) gave no feedback on success or when the party couldn't afford it — the message was being set but rendered in the wrong panel

### Added
- Estate Storage and the Travel tab's Mule/Wagon/Saddlebags storage now have an "Add from table…" catalog picker (Weapons, Armour & Shields, Alchemy, Consumables, Jewellery, Light, Misc, Tools), matching the picker already on a hero's backpack, alongside the existing manual item entry

## [1.31.1] — 2026-08-12

### Removed
- Sacred Grove removed from Furnishing the Manor — confirmed as Druid-specific content (where Druids level up), tied to The False Prophet expansion, which isn't in scope for this app

## [1.31.0] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- Buying an Estate (Settlements tab, Silver City only): 4000c one-time purchase, waives the inn fee automatically whenever the party stays overnight in Silver City
- Furnishing the Manor: all 9 confirmed rooms from p159 (Alchemist Lab, Archery Range, Training Grounds, Wizard's Study, Shrine, Smithy, Crops/Hen House/Pigsty, Garden, Kennel), correctly limited to one commission between quests that isn't usable until after the next dungeon trip. Archery Range/Training Grounds, Shrine, Smithy, Crops, and Garden each get a working resolver (per-hero +1d2 training, free Pray with 1-4 on 1d6, party-wide +1d3 Durability repair, 1d8+days rations, 1d6+2 ingredient gather straight into the Alchemist's components) — Alchemist Lab/Wizard's Study/Kennel show their effect text but hook into other tabs or the Companions' Expansion instead of a dedicated resolver. A 10th room, "Sacred Grove", is included but flagged unconfirmed pending rulebook verification
- Estate Storage: an unlimited item list at the estate, same editable ENC/Value/Durability fields as a hero's backpack
- Ghostly Events: the full 1d10 trigger roll (7-10 on the night before departure) plus the 10-entry Ghostly Events Table, 8 of 10 entries fully mechanized (Luck/CS/RS/Energy buffs and penalties, wizard miscast range, and — reusing the same Curse Table as the Fortune Teller — a full multi-hero Curse resolution). Family Heirlooms and Hidden Treasure correctly surface as physical card-draw/dungeon-setup prompts rather than fabricated rolls
- Side Quest: The Grieving Mother — full state tracker (triggered/succeeded/failed) with the quest's read-aloud text, a reward flow that adds the actual magical Longsword (+2 DMG) to a chosen hero's backpack, and automatic queuing of the forced Ghostly Event #8 on failure
- Alberta's Magnificent Animals (Settlements tab, Whiteport only): purchase Horses, Camels, Saddlebags, Mules, and Wagons at their real costs, tracked as party-owned counts
- Storage panel on the Travel tab: Mule (100 ENC), Wagon (500 ENC), and Saddlebags (10 ENC each) capacity, scaled by how many are owned, using the same item-list component as Estate Storage

## [1.30.2] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- New "Travel" tab covering overland movement between settlements/dungeons (rulebook "Travelling and Skirmishes" chapter): a Movement calculator (Walking/Wagon/Mule = 3 MP vs all Horses/Camels = 6 MP, tap to log Road/Off-road/Desert hexes with running MP totals and undo), a Daily Event Roll (1d12, correct trigger range and event card type per terrain), Rations & Foraging (1 ration/day feeds the whole party, 2/day in the Ancient Lands where Foraging isn't possible; Foraging is a single roll for the whole party with +10 in trees/-10 on a road, auto-applies the hunger penalty — every hero's CON halved and Party Morale -4, non-cumulative, lifted automatically next time the party eats — on a failed roll), and a Daily Rest resolver (+1d6 HP and Energy regen per hero, full Energy with a Bed Roll)
- Skirmishes note added to the Travel tab pointing at the Combat tab for resolution, with a reference table for which of the four outdoor tile types to use

## [1.30.1] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- Header now shows a small badge stating which rulebook and QRS versions the app is built against (Core Rulebook v2.4 · QRS v2.24)

## [1.30.0] — 2026-08-11

### Added
- New "Actions" tab, split out from Dice, covering hazard/obstacle mechanics: Door / Chest Opener, Portcullis, Cobweb Covered Opening, Levers, and Search a Tile (Dice now holds just the Quick Dice roller and Loot Roller)
- Portcullis tool — pick a hero, optionally add a helper in the other adjacent slot and up to 2 heroes chiming in from the far side (each +10 STR), then attempt to lift (1 AP, retriable, +1 Threat on a failed attempt)
- Cobweb Covered Opening tool — 2 AP, automatically succeeds, raises Threat +1, and rolls 1d10 for Giant Spiders on a 9-10
- Levers tool — prepares a deck of 1 black + 1d4+1 red cards, draws and rolls on the correct table when a lever is pulled (1 AP, blocked while known enemies are on the table), tracks remaining deck size, and lets clues discard a red card without rolling. Numeric outcomes (Threat, Party Morale/Sanity, a party-held dungeon Luck Point, pit-trap damage) auto-apply; spatial outcomes (portcullis drop, Wandering Monster, Treasure Chamber, iron cage ambush) are shown in full for manual resolution at the table

## [1.29.9] — 2026-08-11

### Added
- New "Wizards' Guild" and "Inner Sanctum" boxes appear on the Settlements tab when viewing Silver City, for actually learning a spell or prayer — pick a hero, pick from spells/prayers at or below their level, cost auto-calculates at 200c + 100c per level above 1 (spells have a "Found via Grimoire" free option), and confirming deducts the coins and adds it straight to the hero's sheet

### Changed
- Spells and Prayers can no longer be attached to a hero from the Compendium tab — that was a free, uncosted shortcut with no level or location check. Compendium is now reference-only for these two categories; learning happens through the new Wizards' Guild / Inner Sanctum boxes instead. Talents, Perks, and Special Rules are unaffected. Anything already attached via the old Compendium button stays on the hero sheet untouched
- "Learn a Spell" and "Learn a Prayer" removed from the general Activities/Resolve-an-Activity lists, since they now have their own dedicated boxes

## [1.29.8] — 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- Learn a Prayer was available in any settlement with a Temple — the book specifies this is only done in the Inner Sanctum in Silver City, so it's now gated to that specific service instead of the general Temples category

## [1.29.7] — 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- Award Experience (Party tab) gave no confirmation when clicked unless a hero happened to level up from it — a normal award now always shows a toast confirming the XP was given, alongside any level-up toasts

### Changed
- Every button now has a hover highlight and a visible press-darken effect on desktop (mouse clicks), independent of the touch-only press animation already used on most buttons
- On larger screens (1024px+ and 1536px+), the whole app now scales up — text, icons, spacing, and borders all grow together — for easier reading at desktop viewing distances, while the mobile-first layout itself is unchanged

## [1.29.6] — 2026-08-10

### Changed
- Hero card: the XP-to-next-level note now sits inline next to the XP field (e.g. "4500 / 5000 (500 to go)") instead of a small caption underneath
- The Level Up button is now clearly labelled as a manual override ("Override: Level Up"), styled as a secondary action, with an updated tooltip explaining that levelling up already happens automatically once XP crosses the threshold

## [1.29.5] — 2026-08-09

### Changed
- Cast a Spell's hero picker now only lists heroes who actually know a spell or have a magic profession (Wizard, Druid) — non-casters no longer clutter the dropdown

## [1.29.4] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- The Increased Power note ("add +N to this spell's DMG/Healing") was showing up on a failed cast, even though nothing actually happened for it to boost — now only appears when the spell's effect actually executes
- Touch spells (which can be Restoration or Destruction school too, like Healing Hand) were never showing the Increased Power note at all, on success or failure, because that field was missing from both of Touch's own result paths

## [1.29.3] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- Corrected Spell Casting against the actual rules text (the flowchart alone had led me slightly astray in a few places): Touch Spells now correctly need BOTH a CS+20 touch roll and the standard Arcane Arts roll, not just the touch roll — a missed touch costs half Mana and skips the Arcane Arts roll entirely
- Dispel is now only offered for Ranged spells — the book is explicit that Touch and Close Combat spells can't be dispelled at all
- The dispel target is now the enemy's RS/2 (rounded down), not their raw RS — matches "Ranged Skills/2 (RDD) for enemy casters"
- A dispelled cast now costs the full intended Mana instead of half — "a hero whose spell is cancelled must still expend the intended mana"
- Miscast now costs half Mana for every spell type, including Incantations — "the Mana is used as though the spell had failed", with no special exception
- Perfect Cast's Mana refund (a natural 01-05) is no longer clamped to the hero's max Mana, since the book explicitly allows it to temporarily exceed the cap

### Added
- The actual Miscast Table (1d10) and its Demon sub-table (1d4, for a roll of 9) are now in the app — a miscast rolls on it automatically and shows the real result instead of just pointing at page 63
- Increased Power is now properly gated to Restoration/Destruction school spells only, capped at the lower of 5 or the caster's level, and adds its +2 Mana per level to the cast's cost
- Two new restrictions: an adjacent enemy blocks everything except Touch Spells, and Incantations can only be cast while in a settlement

## [1.29.2] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- Cast a Spell now runs the full Hero Spell Casting flowchart instead of just deducting Mana — spell type (Ranged/Touch/Incantation) is read straight off the spell's own data, the right skill check formula applies for each (AA-CV for Ranged/Incantation, CS+20 for Touch), Focus AP adds +10 to Arcane Arts, an enemy caster in range can attempt to dispel a successful cast, and a roll above the Miscast Threshold flags a miscast
- The Miscast Threshold (base 95, -5 if injured, -5 per AP of Focus, -1 per point of increased power) is calculated automatically and shown live as you set those options
- Mana handling follows the book's actual outcomes: full cost on a normal success, a full refund on a lucky 01-05 roll, half cost (rounded down) lost on a failed or dispelled cast, and no Mana lost at all on an incantation-specific miscast or plain failure

### Notes
- "Caster injured" and "increased power" don't have a documented definition/cost anywhere available, so both are self-reported toggles rather than auto-calculated
- A miscast currently just flags itself and points at the Miscast Table (p63) — the table's actual results aren't in the app yet, so nothing auto-applies from it
- This is a best-faith reading of a dense, hand-drawn flowchart with a lot of crossing branches — worth a sanity check against the book if a specific outcome looks off in play

## [1.29.1] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- Random (no-recipe) potion mixing — Mix a Potion now has a "No Recipe (Random)" mode alongside the existing recipe-based one. No +10 bonus, but a success rolls the real Potions Table for that strength (a single 1d12 table for Weak/Supreme, and Standard's own 1d3-then-1d10 table across three sub-lists) instead of guaranteeing a specific result
- A successful random mix gets written down as a new recipe automatically, exactly like the book's flowchart describes — so the next time you find the same components, you can just use the recipe instead of rolling blind again

## [1.29.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- New Alchemy tab with three sections: Recipe Book (the 6 Common Recipes every alchemist knows automatically, plus each hero's own learned recipes — "Mix This" jumps straight to mixing), Mix a Potion (shows exactly what's missing from your inventory, applies the recipe/exquisite roll bonuses automatically, and rolls it), and Gather & Harvest (the overland-travel ingredient search by habitat, and post-battle part harvesting from up to 3 enemies)
- Full Monster Parts table (80+ enemies) and the habitat-based Ingredients table power Harvest Parts and Gather Ingredients respectively — both correctly apply the Exquisite bonus when the Alchemy roll itself lands 01-10, not the follow-up table rolls
- Learning a custom recipe needs no roll — just name it, pick a strength, and fill the component slots (validated for the right count, uniqueness, and at least one Ingredient + one Part)
- Mixing a potion applies the full rule set: +10 for following a known recipe, +10 more if any component used is Exquisite (flat, regardless of how many), and a failed mix loses the components but keeps the Bottle
- The False Prophet Expansion (Knight, Druid, Duckfolk, Half-Ogre) is now grouped under its own header in the Species/Profession pickers and Reference tab, separate from the core game's options

### Notes
- Knight and Druid are selectable but still have no Improvement Point cost data, so IP spending won't work correctly for them until their starting stats are added
- Random (no-recipe) mixing isn't built yet — every mix currently goes through a known recipe

## [1.28.1] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- Revenge (Minotaur, #16)'s reward XP is now confirmed at 1000 XP — a known typo in the v1.2 rulebook update had cut this line off; an earlier printing had it intact

## [1.28.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- All 20 Backgrounds now have their real Personal Quest/Trait text, XP rewards, and mechanical effects, replacing the flavour-only name list — this covers a huge range of mechanics: one-time XP quests (Wanderlust, Fables, A New Home...), starting conditions that can only be cured by a specific in-fiction feat (The Well's Claustrophobia, Arachnophobia), a branching multi-outcome quest (The Lost Brother), repeatable kill-counters (both Revenge backgrounds, Sworn Enemy), item rewards (The Heirloom's sword, Proving Your Worth's armour), and permanent stat/party effects that apply automatically when picked (Bad Tempered's Morale/Sanity trade-off, The Fraud's starting penalties, The Noble's starting coins)
- Each hero's card shows their background's full text plus whatever action fits it — a one-tap XP claim, an item claim, a counter with a claim threshold, or a branch picker for The Lost Brother. Complex multi-session quests are self-reported (you confirm when the in-fiction condition is met) rather than simulated, since several need dungeon-start dice rolls the app has no hooks for yet
- Max Sanity now factors in a background's bonus (Bad Tempered's +2) alongside the existing mental-condition penalty, consistently everywhere Sanity max gets recalculated

### Notes
- Revenge (Minotaur, #16)'s reward XP wasn't known yet — defaulted to 250 to match the other Revenge background, worth confirming against the book

## [1.27.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- A successful roll in Resolve an Activity now automatically logs the matching Activity Points to the Activities panel above — no more separate manual "Log Activity" click needed for Pray, Fortune Teller, Gambling, Horse Racing, Arena Fighting, Tending to Those Memories, Treat Mental Conditions, or Banking. Only logs on an actual attempt (affordability/precondition checks still block first, same as before) — a bad roll still logs the time spent, since the activity happened either way, just the outcome was unlucky

## [1.26.2] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- The Settlement tab had two separate mechanisms with no link between them — Activities (a log of AP/time spent) and Resolve an Activity (where dice actually get rolled and effects applied) — with no indication that picking, say, Treat Mental Conditions or Pray in the Activities list wouldn't actually do anything mechanical. Picking an activity that has a real dice-roll counterpart now shows a button that jumps straight to it in Resolve an Activity, pre-selected. The two lists also used different names for the same thing (Gamble/Gambling, Read your Fortune/Fortune Teller, Tend to those Memories/Tending to Those Memories) which made it harder to notice the connection even if you were looking for it

## [1.26.1] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- Diagnosing a mental condition was only capping current Sanity down if needed, instead of actually resetting it — the book says Sanity "will go back up to 8 minus the number of current conditions," so it now genuinely resets to that new value rather than staying at 0

### Added
- Every diagnosed mental condition on a hero's card now shows its full rule text as a reminder, not just conditions with an extra rolled detail (which enemy, which faction, which trigger) — so it's clear what each one actually does at a glance
- Clarified that Settlement Activity Points (used for things like Treat Mental Conditions, 5 of them) are a completely separate pool from a hero's combat Action Points on the Turn tab — they share the "AP" abbreviation in the book, which reads as a bug but is actually two unrelated resources

## [1.26.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- Mental Conditions — when a hero's Sanity hits 0, a "Roll a Mental Condition" button appears on their card. Rolls the real 1d10 table (Hate, Acute Stress, Lingering Trauma, Fear of the Dark, Arachnophobia, Jumpy, Irrational Fear, Claustrophobia, Depression), re-rolling on a duplicate diagnosis. Conditions with a clean stat/energy effect (Fear of the Dark and Acute Stress: -10 RES, Depression: -2 Energy) apply automatically; the rest are tracked with a reminder of their effect since they're situational rather than a number to change
- Diagnosing Hate asks which enemy the hero last fought; Lingering Trauma and Irrational Fear roll their own sub-tables automatically (the trigger situation, and the feared monster faction)
- Max Sanity now correctly follows the rule "8 minus current condition count" instead of a flat 8 — gets tighter with each diagnosis, and loosens back up as conditions are cured
- Treat Mental Conditions (Settlement tab) now actually treats a specific diagnosed condition — picks which one if a hero has more than one, and on a success (1-5 on 1d6, 1000c) reverses its effect and recalculates max Sanity, instead of operating on the generic conditions list it was using as a placeholder before this table was available
- Added the missing "Miscasting a spell: -1d3 Sanity" trigger to the Sanity event picker

## [1.25.2] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- Door / Chest Opener's "not enough AP" message was invisible on the very first attempt — it only rendered inside the results box, which itself only appears after a door has actually been opened. Now shows in its own spot above the button whenever no door has been rolled yet, so the message is never silently swallowed

## [1.25.1] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- AP wasn't actually being deducted for Door/Chest Opener or Search a Tile actions — both let you keep clicking indefinitely. The Dice tab receives updateHero(id, next) as a two-argument function, but the shared AP-spending helper was calling it with just one merged object, so the hero id never matched and the update silently did nothing. Fixed the one call site — everything AP-related on the Dice tab now actually spends it

## [1.25.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- Search a Tile on the Dice tab — 2 AP, rolls a Perception test (with the group bonus: +10 for 2 heroes searching together, +5 more per hero beyond that) and, on success, rolls the full 1d100 outcome table (secret door to a treasure chamber, fine/mundane treasure, hidden levers, coins, a sprung trap, or nothing), with a toggle to add the +10 corridor modifier

## [1.24.4] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- Tapping the Q/B badge on a backpack item silently did nothing when the hero didn't have the 2 AP for it, or when Quick Slots were already full — there was no restriction by item type, the feedback just wasn't visible anywhere except the History log. Both cases now show a clear message right where you tapped
- Backpack item name was a cramped inline text field competing with Value/ENC/Dur for space — it's now its own full-width line above the stats, matching how the equipped Weapon/Armour sections already work

## [1.24.3] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- Equip button on backpack items — any item matching a real Weapon or Armour table entry gets a small sword icon that equips it directly, preserving its actual current durability instead of resetting to full. Whatever was previously equipped there swaps back into the backpack automatically, so nothing gets lost either direction

## [1.24.2] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- The backpack's "Add from table…" dropdown now includes Weapons and Armour & Shields as spares — previously it only covered general equipment (potions, tools, consumables, etc.), so the only way to carry a second weapon or a backup shield was typing it in manually. Picking one adds it to the backpack with its price/ENC filled in, without equipping it — the Weapon/Armour pickers above are still what actually equips something

## [1.24.1] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- Clearing an equipped weapon or armour piece deleted it entirely instead of keeping the item — it now moves into the backpack (with its price looked up automatically if it matches a table entry) so unequipping something doesn't lose it

## [1.24.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- Short Rest on the Turn tab — one button resolves every numeric step: -1 food ration, Threat -5 followed by a threat roll (same Threat Table logic as Start of Turn), Party Morale +2, +1d6 HP per hero, Energy regen (1d6 per missing point, recovered on 1-3 — or fully restored automatically if the hero's carrying a Bed Roll), and full Mana for any caster

### Notes
- Board-state steps from the checklist (arranging heroes, barring the door, moving Wandering Monsters, brewing potions, and the Ambush roll — no data found yet for that one) still need doing by hand; the full checklist stays in Reference

## [1.23.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- Quick Slots on the hero card's Backpack — each item gets a tappable Q/B badge to move it between the backpack and a quick slot (2 AP, blocked if the hero's out of AP or the quick slots are full). Capacity is base 3, raised to 4 or 5 by an owned Extended Battle Belt or Combat Harness
- Trade Gear on the Turn tab — move an item from one hero's backpack to another's for 1 AP each (both heroes need the AP or the trade doesn't happen at all)

## [1.22.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- New Turn tab — Round counter with a "Next Round" button that resets every hero's AP to 2 (per the QRS: "All models have 2 AP") and counts down tracked light sources, removing any that go out
- Action Points tracker, 2 per hero, with quick -1 AP buttons and a per-hero reset — this is the first place in the app that tracks combat AP at all, separate from Settlement Activity Points
- Light Sources tracker — add a torch/lantern with however many turns it has left, and it counts down automatically each round
- Initiative Bag — builds the actual hero/enemy token bag (with all the modifiers: named/large monsters, Perfect Hearing, Swift Leader, Sneaky, a bashed door, an ambush) and draws tokens one at a time to build turn order, instead of just listing the rules as reference text
- Door / Chest Opener (Dice tab) now actually spends AP from the acting hero — 1 AP to open/force/pry, 2 AP to pick a lock — and blocks the action with a clear message if they're out

### Changed
- The Start of Turn resolver moved from the Party tab to the new Turn tab, since it's step 1 of the Turn Sequence rather than persistent party state

## [1.21.1] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- Door / Chest Opener buttons (Pick the Lock, Force Open, Use a Crowbar) gave no visible confirmation when tapped — added a colour-coded feedback line after every action, plus a press animation on all the buttons so a tap now visibly registers

## [1.21.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- Start of Turn resolver on the Party tab — rolls the Scenario die (1d10) and, on a 9-10, automatically rolls Threat (1d20) against the current level: a natural 20 lowers Threat -5, a roll above the current level raises it +1, and anything at or below rolls on the matching Threat Table (In Battle / Not in Battle, toggled with one button) and applies the result's Threat change automatically

## [1.20.1] — 2026-08-09

### Changed
- Cleaned up wording throughout the changelog to focus on what changed in the app rather than how it was researched

## [1.20.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- Door / Chest Opener on the Dice tab — one button rolls the lock check (1d10) and trap check (1d6) together and raises Threat +1 automatically. If locked, shows the Pick Lock penalty and HP, with buttons for Pick the Lock (2 AP, no extra Threat, jams on a fumble), Force Open (+2 Threat per attempt, enter your damage roll), and Use a Crowbar (fixed 8+DB damage, +1 Threat) — each tracking the door/chest's remaining HP until it breaks open

### Notes
- Trap resolution itself (drawing a trap card) stays manual — the app doesn't have trap card data, so a trapped result just flags it as a reminder
- The lock-pick fumble threshold isn't stated explicitly in the rulebook excerpt this is based on; a natural 00 (100 on d100) is used as the fumble trigger, matching the common convention elsewhere in the system

## [1.19.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added
- Banking added to Resolve an Activity — each hero can hold a separate balance in all three Silver City banks (Chamberlings Reserve, Smartfall Bank, The Vault), with Deposit/Withdraw buttons and a "Roll It" that runs the 1d20 profit/loss check for the selected bank (each bank has its own slice of the roll range, including a "Robbed!" result that wipes that bank's balance)

### Notes
- This completes the settlement feature set (settlement services, activities, and events). Remaining roadmap: Start of Turn/Threat Table, the Door/Chest opener, Sanity automation, the Alchemy potion-maker, and Backgrounds mechanical effects

## [1.18.1] — 2026-08-08

### Fixed
- Buy a Dog and Buy a Familiar showed up as normal settlement activities with no indication they need the separate Companions' Expansion — both now note that right in the Activities picker, since this app has no mechanical effect for them without it

## [1.18.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added
- Temporary Effects tracker — Temple boons and Curses now actually apply to the hero (not just a log message), show up in a red "Temporary Effects (until next dungeon exit)" box on the hero's card, and clear with a single tap per effect or all at once with "Left dungeon — clear all"
- Curse! (the settlement event) now genuinely applies the rolled curse to every hero, matching the book ("apply the curse to all heroes"), instead of leaving it as a manual note
- Fortune Teller's roll-1 result ("treat one enemy hit as a miss next quest") is now logged as a reminder in Temporary Effects too, even though there's no stat to reverse

### Changed
- Refactored the Talents auto-apply system (v1.6.0) and the new Temple/Curse effects to share one applyEffectDelta() function, so both work identically and reverse cleanly

## [1.17.1] — 2026-08-08

### Added
- Arena Fighting now resolves the full result, not just win/lose: winning pays out entry fee x a level/bracket multiplier plus XP (50/100/150 for Group/Semi/Final) straight to the hero, a Final win rolls for a bonus treasure, and losing costs HP (2/4/6 by bracket) and 2 Sanity
- The entry fee is only charged on the Group round, matching the rule that it covers all three brackets — rolling Semi or Final afterward for the same attempt assumes it's already paid, while still using the same fee amount as the payout base for that bracket's multiplier

## [1.17.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added
- Resolve an Activity panel on the Settlement tab — rolls and applies 7 settlement activities that previously had no mechanic behind them: Pray at Temple (all 6 gods' boons, auto-filtered to whichever temples the current settlement actually has), Fortune Teller, Gambling (Luck reduces the roll without spending it, per the rule), Horse Racing (DEX test, level-based payout multiplier, catastrophe-strikes failure), Arena Fighting (CS check with HP/STR/bracket modifiers), Tending to Those Memories (free Sanity + optional paid top-up), and Treat Mental Conditions (cures a listed condition)

### Notes
- Arena Fighting resolves win/lose, but there's no prize-money data for it, so payout amounts are still up to you
- Temple/Curse/Feast-style boons that last "until the next dungeon exit" are applied immediately with a reminder in the result — there's no duration-tracking system yet, so remove them manually when the dungeon ends

## [1.16.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added
- Side Quest table (1d6) wired in — the Settlement Event "Side Quest" now has a Roll It button that names the actual quest instead of just saying "roll on the Side Quest Table", and the Roll Available Quests side-quest check names it too when it triggers. Full quest details still live in your own Quest Book — this just automates picking which one

## [1.15.1] — 2026-08-08

### Added
- Detailed Silver City street map added to the Maps section on the Settlement tab — shows named locations (Jarl's Palace, The Market, the guild halls, the Arena, the Temple Grounds, etc.), zoomable like the other two maps

## [1.15.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added
- Real per-settlement data from "The Settlements of the Southern Part of the Kingdom" (p134-137): actual Inn cost for all 11 settlements (15c-65c, not a flat guess), which auto-fills when you pick a settlement instead of needing to type it in
- Each settlement now shows its available Services and which gods' Temples are present, plus settlement-specific notes (Durburim/Birnheim's +2 Durability on locally-made gear, the Outpost's 100c/hero Ancient Lands toll)
- The Activities picker now only shows what the current settlement actually offers — no more seeing "Learn a Spell" at a village with no Wizards' Guild. Guild-based activities (Charge/Identify Magic Item, Learn a Spell, Guild Business, Skill Training) only exist in Silver City, since it's the only settlement with Guilds at all

## [1.14.1] — 2026-08-08

### Fixed
- Inn cost now defaults to 25c (whole party) instead of 0 — still editable per settlement if your table charges differently

### Notes
- Only affects brand-new campaigns — existing saved campaigns keep whatever inn cost they already had (0, most likely), since the app can't tell the difference between "never touched this" and "deliberately set to 0." Update it manually on the Settlement tab if you want the correct default there too

## [1.14.0] — 2026-08-08

### Changed
- Luck is now a proper cur/max stat (like HP, Mana, Energy, Sanity) instead of a bare number. Existing saves migrate automatically — old Luck value becomes both cur and max. Shows as a StatBar alongside the other stats, with the Talents/Level Up bonuses that grant Luck (Lucky, God's Chosen, Halfling's starting Luck, the level-up table) correctly raising the max and refilling the current value
- Rest at Inn now actually restores Luck to max, per the Rest and Recuperation rule ("Mana, Luck and energy are automatically restored") — previously left un-refilled because Luck had no max to restore to
- Rest at Inn no longer just blocks if the party can't afford it — it now applies the rulebook's actual fallback: sleeping in the stable for free, which gives 1d6 HP (instead of 2d6) and only half (rounded down) of the Mana/Luck/Energy deficit

## [1.13.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Backpack now has an "Add from table…" dropdown covering ~35 items from the Equipment Appendix (potions, tools, consumables, jewellery, light sources, misc gear) — picking one adds it with name/value/ENC/durability already filled in. "Add Custom Item" is still there for anything homebrew or not in the book

### Changed
- Replaced the Backpack Size item-count field with a real Backpack Upgrade picker (Small/Medium/Large). Turns out the QRS doesn't cap backpacks by item count at all — capacity is purely STR-based ENC, and Medium/Large backpacks are what actually raise that threshold (+10/+25 ENC, at a cost of -5/-10 DEX while worn, both applied automatically). The old counter wasn't modelling the real rule, so it's gone rather than kept as a parallel system

## [1.12.1] — 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- No way to remove a weapon or armour piece once picked from the table, short of manually clearing every field — both now have a one-tap Clear button that resets the slot back to blank
- Item name was squeezed into a cramped row alongside DEF/ENC/DUR and got clipped on mobile — name is now its own full-width line above the stats, so it's always fully visible

## [1.12.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Levelling up is now automatic — awarding XP (either via "Award XP" on the Party tab, or editing a hero's XP directly) checks it against the XP Levelling table and, if it crosses a threshold, applies the level increase, rolls the HP/Luck/Energy gains, and adds the +15 Improvement Points to that hero's pool, all on its own. A big XP award that crosses two thresholds at once correctly levels up twice
- A gold toast pops up ("[Hero] leveled up! Now level X — ...") no matter which tab triggered it, since Award XP lives on the Party tab but the level-up itself is about a specific hero
- A small gold badge with the Improvement Point count now sits on each hero's button in the Heroes tab whenever they have unspent points, plus a matching dot on the Heroes nav tab itself so it's visible without switching tabs

### Notes
- The manual Level Up button is still there as an override (forces a level regardless of XP, e.g. for house rules) — it's not gated behind the XP threshold, since the automatic path now handles the normal case

## [1.11.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Creation Points are now interactive: a live "X CP left" badge above the Stats grid, with +/− buttons under each stat that spend or refund from the 15-point pool and enforce the 10-per-stat cap — matching the Specialisation rule exactly instead of being a passive counter you had to track yourself
- Improvement Points spending now has a matching − (refund) button next to each stat/skill, undoing a purchase and restoring both the point and the exact IP cost that was paid for it

### Fixed
- Number inputs starting at 0 couldn't be retyped on mobile without manually selecting and deleting the 0 first — tapping into any number field now auto-selects its content, so the next digit typed just overwrites it, across the whole app

## [1.10.1] — 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- Mana was computed as flat WIS instead of WIS x 1.5 rounded down (the actual Magic chapter formula) — fixed in both places it's set (Roll Starting Stats, and picking a caster profession)
- Sanity for brand-new heroes defaulted to 10 instead of the QRS's fixed starting value of 8 (existing saved heroes are untouched — this only affects heroes created from now on)
- Elf and Dwarf species notes didn't mention their actual Traits (Perfect Hearing, Night Vision, Hate Goblins) at all; Halfling's note didn't mention Lucky. All four now documented correctly

### Added
- Roll Starting Stats now auto-applies species Traits that map to a clean bonus: Night Vision (Elf, Dwarf) and Perfect Hearing (Elf) are added as Talents with their real effect, and Halfling gets its starting Luck Point set automatically. Hate Goblins (Dwarf) and Jack of All Trades (Human) still need a manual pick from the Compendium, since they require choosing an enemy/category
- Picking Warrior Priest as a profession now sets starting Energy to 2 instead of 1, matching the QRS (only if Energy is still at its default, so it won't override a manual edit)

## [1.10.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Armour picker on the hero card — each location (Head, Arms, Torso, Legs, Shield) now has a "Pick from table…" dropdown listing the pieces from the Armour & Shields Appendix that actually cover that spot, auto-filling Name/Def/ENC/Durability. A reference line shows Tier, Special rules (Stackable, Clunky, Huge), Cost, Availability, and flags if the piece also covers another location (so ENC only gets counted once)
- Armour pieces are now named — they were previously just bare Def/ENC/Dur numbers with nothing identifying what they were
- Sell & Repair on the Settlement tab now include named armour alongside weapons and backpack items — selling clears the slot, repairing restores real durability on the hero sheet, same as weapons since v1.9.1

## [1.9.1] — 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- Sell & Repair let you type any price and click Sell repeatedly for infinite coins, since it wasn't tied to anything the party actually owned. Sell now requires picking a real item — a hero's equipped weapon, or a named backpack item — and removes it once sold, so it can't be sold twice
- Repair now targets a real damaged weapon and actually restores its durability on the hero sheet, instead of being a disconnected calculator. Backpack items aren't repairable yet since they only store a single durability value, not a current/max pair

## [1.9.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Update-available toast — since updates have been shipping fast, the app now detects when a new version has been deployed (checked hourly while open, plus on every normal page load) and shows a floating banner with a Reload button, instead of you needing to know to manually refresh
- Reloading via that banner automatically opens the changelog afterward, so it's obvious what changed — but only right after an update, not on every ordinary refresh (uses a one-time #log URL hash that gets cleaned up immediately after)

### Changed
- PWA update mode switched from silent auto-update to prompt-based — new versions no longer swap in behind your back mid-session; you control when the reload happens

## [1.8.1] — 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- Armour row on the hero card wrapped DUR onto a second line on narrow phones — each location (Head, Arms, Torso, Legs, Shield) now gets its own sub-header line, with DEF/ENC/DUR fields in a single row underneath that fits within the card width

## [1.8.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Weapon picker on the hero card — a dropdown of all 23 weapons from the Equipment Appendix (Dagger through Elven Bow) that auto-fills Name, DMG, ENC, and Durability (6/6, the QRS default) instead of typing them in by hand
- Once a weapon matching the table is set (picked or typed to match), a reference line shows its Class, Special rules, Cost, Availability, Reload (missile weapons), and the STR needed to wield it — highlighted red if the hero's current STR is under the two-handed minimum

## [1.7.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Sell & Repair calculator on the Settlement tab — settlement-only per the QRS ("This may be done when you visit a settlement"). The book prints it as a lookup table (purchase price vs. lost durability), but every row is exactly price × a fixed percentage per durability step (70/60/50/40/30/20%), so it's a live formula instead: enter a price and it shows sell value or repair cost instantly, with Sell/Repair buttons that move coins in the party pot. Repair is blocked if the party can't afford it, matching the Rest at Inn fix; Sell is blocked below 10c or once an item has lost all its durability, per the rulebook

## [1.6.1] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Combat Talents & Perks quick-reference panel on the Combat tab (Close Combat, Ranged, and Damage modes) — lists every hero's attached Combat-type Talents and Perks with their effect text, so you don't have to flip back to the hero sheet mid-fight

## [1.6.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- 13 Talents with an unconditional numeric bonus now auto-apply to the hero sheet when added or removed from the Compendium — Catlike (+5 DEX), Fast (+1 Movement), Resilient (+5 CON), Strong (+5 STR), Strong Build (+2 HP), God's Chosen (+1 Luck), Disciplined (+10 RES), Hunter (+10 Foraging), Lucky (+1 Luck), Night Vision (+10 Perception), Persistent (+15 Mana), Confident (+5 RES), Strong-Minded (+1 Sanity). Marked with a gold "Auto:" badge in both the Compendium browser and on the hero's attached-talents list. Every other talent (the majority — combat/conditional ones like Hate or Marksman) stays a description card, since there's no safe way to auto-apply a once-per-battle or situational rule
- Movement is now a tracked field on the hero sheet (starts at 4, per the QRS) instead of not existing at all

## [1.5.1] — 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- Rest at Inn applied the HP/Mana/Energy recovery even when the party couldn't afford the inn cost — it now checks affordability first and blocks the whole action with a clear message if the party is short on coins

## [1.5.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Level Up now rolls the actual per-level table: +1d2 HP, and +1 Luck / +1 Energy on the levels that grant them (not just the flat +15 Improvement Points) — hero card also shows XP remaining to the next level
- Spend Improvement Points directly on a hero's card: tap a stat/skill to raise it, cost shown live (doubles past 70), with the +5/stat-skill and +2/HP per-level caps enforced automatically. Knight/Druid aren't in the official QRS cost table, so they stay manual with a note
- Damage Bonus (STR) and Natural Armour (CON) now show as auto-computed badges on the hero stat grid, and the Combat tab's damage calculator has one-tap buttons to fill DB from a hero's STR
- Set Starting Morale from RES button on the Party tab — PM = sum of floor(RES/10) across all heroes; the −10 RES threshold note now shows the real computed half-value once set

### Fixed
- Improvement Point note incorrectly said the cost-doubling threshold was 80 — the QRS says 70

## [1.4.2] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Settlement events that need a follow-up roll now show a "Roll It" button that resolves it automatically: Thief (steals coins), Settlement Feast (bed check + morale), Scrolls Salesman (3 random spells), Assassination Attempt (bandit count + targeted hero), Curse (rolls the Curses Table)
- Reset button on both the Quick Dice and Loot Roller panels — clears recent rolls without switching tabs
- Rest at Inn now shows a confirmation summary (HP/Mana/Energy per hero, inn cost paid) so the button doesn't look like it did nothing

## [1.4.1] — 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- Mobile layout — the tab bar now scrolls horizontally as pill buttons instead of wrapping into a tall stack of rows
- The Settlement activity picker (hero + activity dropdowns) no longer overflows the screen width on narrow phones — it stacks vertically now, with the location note shown below instead of crammed into the dropdown text
- Added a site-wide safeguard so no element can force horizontal page scroll again

### Added
- Maps section on the Settlement tab — The Known World and the Silver City Area, tap to open full-screen with pinch-to-zoom and +/- zoom buttons

## [1.4.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- New Settlement tab — pick from all 11 settlements (correct quest dice/colour per the QRS), roll the 1d12 settlement-entry event with the full event table, roll available quests (1d6, or 2d20 for Silver City) plus the 1d8 side-quest check
- Per-hero Activity Point ledger — the full settlement action list (blacksmith, temple, guilds, etc.) with AP costs, logged per hero with undo and a one-tap ledger reset for a new visit
- Rest at Inn — select which heroes stay, rolls 2d6 HP recovery per hero and refills Mana/Energy, with an editable whole-party inn cost that deducts coins

### Notes
- Luck has no tracked maximum in this app, so Inn rest doesn't auto-refill it — adjust manually if your table restores Luck at the inn

## [1.3.2] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- JSON-LD structured data (schema.org `WebApplication`) in `index.html` for search engines
- `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and a canonical URL tag
- `llms.txt` with a plain-text app summary — an informal, unofficial convention some AI tools check when browsing; not a guarantee any given assistant reads it
- iOS `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` / `apple-mobile-web-app-title` meta tags, so the home-screen icon gets a short title instead of the full page `<title>`

### Notes
- This is a client-rendered SPA with no server-side rendering, so individual app content (compendium entries, etc.) isn't indexable as separate pages by search engines — the realistic SEO value here is a well-described single landing page, not per-feature indexing

## [1.3.1] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Floating install banner — prompts visitors to install the app, with a working Install button on Android/desktop (via the `beforeinstallprompt` API) and Share → Add to Home Screen instructions on iOS, since Safari doesn't expose an install API. Dismissing it is remembered (stored per-browser) so it won't show again for that visitor

## [1.3.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- The app is now a full PWA — installable to your home screen/desktop with an offline-capable service worker, its own icon, and a proper app name instead of just a browser tab (via `vite-plugin-pwa`)
- Favicon added (was missing before) — same icon used across favicon, home-screen icon, and Apple touch icon

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Heroes tab now shows one hero at a time via sub-tabs (name pills, horizontally scrollable), with Add Hero as a fixed + button beside them, instead of stacking every hero's full card in one long scroll
- Adding a hero automatically switches to its new tab

### Removed
- The per-hero collapse/expand toggle — redundant now that only one hero is shown at a time

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-06

### Added
- Class skills now auto-calculate from profession + stats (skill = source stat + a per-profession modifier), with a Recalculate button to resync at any time without losing the Free Skill bonus
- Wizard/Druid starting Mana auto-fills from WIS, per the rulebook
- Encumbrance now shows a red "eff" value on every stat and skill when a hero is overloaded, and automatically applies the −10 penalty when autofilling the Combat calculator or Stat/Skill Check tool from a hero
- ENC is now tracked on weapons and armour, not just backpack items
- Campaign export/import — download a campaign as a JSON file for backup, import it back in (here or on another device) as a new campaign
- In-app changelog viewer, linked from the footer

### Fixed
- Hero delete now requires a two-step confirm, matching the existing campaign-delete pattern
- Buy Me a Coffee button switched from their JS widget (which calls `document.write()` and breaks in React apps) to their static link+image button

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-05

### Added

- Background (20-entry flavour table, with a roll button)
- Free Skill picker — automatically applies/removes the +10 bonus as you change it
- Creation Points and Improvement Points (levelling) counters

- Conditions as removable pills, added via free text
- Talents/Perks/Spells/Prayers/Special Rules shown as description cards, grouped by type/school/level, not just bare tags
- Separate Comments/notes field

**Combat calculator**

- Damage calculator (Weapon DMG + DB − NA − Armour)
- Stat/Skill check roller with hero + skill autofill
- Cast Spell and Say Prayer panels — pick a hero, pick from what they know, and it deducts Mana/Energy automatically with clear feedback when there isn't enough

**Compendium**
- Full searchable database: 99 Talents, 43 Perks, 18 Prayers, 54 Spells, 64 monster Special Rules

**Other**

- Vercel Analytics
- MIT license, public-facing README

### Fixed
- Backpack table layout now uses flexbox with fixed-scale width classes instead of arbitrary grid columns, so it renders identically in the Claude-artifact preview and the deployed build
- Free Skill bonus is now visibly highlighted on its skill card instead of being an invisible +10

### Notes
- Improvement Points (levelling) and Creation Points are tracked as counters only — the actual per-stat/skill point cost table (rulebook p54) isn't available to this app, so increases are applied manually
- Level-ups are manual (via the Level Up button), not auto-triggered by XP, since the XP-per-level thresholds aren't available to this app
- Racial max stats are only known for Duckfolk and Half-Ogre; other species don't show a cap
